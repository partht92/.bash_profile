# .bash_profile
Bash Profile that I use, if you'd like to use it too, just add the ".bash_profile" file to your root (with that file name).

It includes git branch tracking as well as a few git shortcut aliases and niceties for Node development.  Also a cute little icon (modified with the CHAR variable) :)
